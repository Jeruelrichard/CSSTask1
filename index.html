    <h2> Hello, I'm Jeruel Richard.</h2>
    <p> I'm going to put it plainly to you. I'm a tech newbie. My love for the world of programming goes as far back as 2015 when I was 8.<br>
        I was a game addict and a game lord, and I was told I could create my own games. That birthed my very slow but very steady and undying journey in the programming world.<br>
        I began to envision myself making my own games as my Uncle opened my eyes to programming and various programming languages. And despite not knowing a single thing about coding, I fell in love with it.<br>
        I hadn't a laptop or a smartphone then but my desire persisted. I made a rough book out of one of my schoolbooks I no longer used, and used that book to jot down the games and events, happenings, design of how my games would be. Kinda like a clumsy flowchartðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚<br>
        Most of the games though were more or less, copycats of already existing games like Subway Surfers, Gameloft's The Avengers, Cooking Fever, Beach Buggy Racing.<br><br>
        In 2018, most probably because of the World Cup, my interest in football solidified. I slowly, subconsciously longed to watch football and play football games constantly.<br>
        In 2019, I played my first ever football game on Android Device. Wiinning Eleven 2012. It was offline and I so loved it then.<br>
        In 2020, I had my first ever Android, and I was an obsessed football fanatic. Barcelona fan. Messi the <strong>GOAT</strong>. 500mb was enough for downloading of 10+ YouTube videos watching the GOAT and football analysis of other things.<br>
        I watched videos on PES, FIFA and DLS too. I was obssessed with the big 3 of Football video games. I became an instant PES fanatic and wished so hard and bad to play the game on mobile because the graphics was so scintillatinbg.<bR>
        I was heartbroken when I discovered my device could not carry the latest version then, and the game had become online. I swore to make my own football game; ASSOC., and it would be offline, and put Konami out of business.<br><br>
        At the time I made myself that promise, most probably 2020, I still had no single knowledge of code. <strong>BUT!!</strong> I did have knowledge on IDEs, Game engines, Programming languages and their best functions, Professions in the tech world and exactly what they do, and I had made up my mind to become a software engineer.<br><br>
        In 2023, after I finished WAEC, NECO, graduation, and a well deserved 2 weeks holiday vacation in my foster grandmom's house in Port Harcourt, I began working as a mathematics teacher while learning Python at the side from some apps on Playstore. Python, because I was told by ChatGPT then that it was the easiest to learn.<br>
        I made a little progress, then switched to html. Made a little progress there too, and stopped. You can call on Inconsistency for that one.<br>
        In 2024 January, I got gifted an HP laptop (the one I still use now) from America, and I rekindled interest in Python as I actively sought admission to FUTO for Cyber Security.<br>
        This time, I went some very, <em>very</em> good distance with it, learning from <a href="wwww.youtube.com/@BroCodez">Bro Codez</a> on Youtube. I had to stop because FUTO called, and I couldn't go with my laptop to the hostel as it was rumoured to be perilous.<br><br>
        Fast forward to May's ending 2025. First semester's ending. Dreams, goals and ambition of the tech world for a decade now, unwavering. I decided to rebegin this time, with something basic and scalable. Something if i became good with in a year, I'd be earning good wads from it.<br>
        First week of June, my cousin posted a screenshot of his chat to my favourite teacher of all time (she thought me in Primary 3, also 2015, really GOATed year mann). In the chat was his request to her to put him on some progamming lesson basics since she was into backend dev.<br>
        In the screenshot, she unhesitatingly sent him a link to a form, asked him to fill it quickly as the deadline was around the corner.<br>
        Not trusting him one bit to send me the link graciously on his own accord despite him knowing my undying passion for Coding, I screenshotted the screenshot before he could delete from his status. Had ChatGPT copy the link out for me and voila! Genesys TechHub UpSkill was born into my life.<br>
        I took the path of WebDev on the 3 months journey. And currently, we are in our 3rd week of learning. In August we should be done, and I'll be proud to say the least, "I can develop a basic website." ðŸŽ‰<br><br>
        So that's just about that concerning my WebDev journey. Please feel free to tell me about yours in the comment section.</p>
